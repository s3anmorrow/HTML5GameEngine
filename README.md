# HTML5GameEngine
A simple game engine to use for workshops on HTML5 game development to students from junior high to high school levels. Students focus primarly on spritesheet generation using 
Adobe Flash CC and CreateJS ZOE. Primary learning outcome is a greater appreciation to the artform of game development (and the huge amount of work!)<br/><br/>
Requirements are:
- entire game engine deployed in a folder on desktop
- Adobe Flash CC opened to gameAssets.fla (htdocs/lib) with playback head on “playerMoving” blank keyframe
- ZOE Installed (Adobe AIR App) and running
- run miniWeb server (may require permissions)
- using the IP URL provided by miniWeb hit game.htm in chrome
- save a bookmark to this page on the desktop where the student can easily find it
- shut down chrome to avoid distraction during workshop but keep miniWeb running
- minweb is required because the game engine must run through a server due to asset preloading. You cannot run it by double clicking on game.htm and running locally in the browser.

The game engine was implemented using the CreateJS framework.<br/><br/>
